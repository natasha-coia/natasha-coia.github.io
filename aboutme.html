                <h2>Hello, my name is Natasha Coia. I'm a current Computer Science Undergraduate at the University of York.
                    It's nice to meet you!
                </h2>
                <p>I've been interested in mathematics and problem solving for as long as I can remember - as cheesy as that sounds!
                    But I have also had a passion in leading others and working towards something that I believe in.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently searching for a Year in Industry placement in 2021/22 for 9-12 months based in Sweden. My areas of interest
                    are data science and machine learning, however I am willing to be flexible and try new areas in the Computer Science field.
                </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I was born and grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand, living there until I was 12 when my parents decided to take me and my
                    siblings out of school to experience travelling the world. We ended up settling back down in North Yorkshire, England, which
                    is where I completed my GCSEs and A Levels. I achieved 11 GCSEs ranged from A*-B at Caedmon College Whitby, before moving to 
                    Scarborough Sixth Form where I completed my A Levels, gaining ABC (one mark off a B!) in Maths, Physics and Further Maths 
                    respectively, as well as an A in AS Computer Science, and a C in a programming-based EPQ. I started at the University of York 
                    in October of 2019, where I achieved an average autumn term grade of 81.5%, before the rest of my first year exams were cancelled
                    due to COVID-19.
                </p>

                <h2>Extra-Curricular</h2>
                <p>I have always striven to excel both in and out of my academic education, from being in the drama club and a part of the student
                    news team at my college, to mentoring numerous students during my time at sixth form.
                    In my first year at the University of York I took on the role of First Year Course Representative where I was able to represent my
                    year group to the Department, as well as founding and chairing York's Animal Crossing Society. I am now heading into my second year
                    of University, having landed the role of Computer Science Department Representative 2020/21.
